									<h4>Turnkey Event Production</h4>
									<p>We do it all, start to finish.</p>

								<p>Codified's team will work with you from day one to develop your event and its direction, including presenting business cases, developing marketing plans, and partnering with members of the community. From there, we'll contact vendors, design your space, come up with the event flow, and work with you on hacker engagement.</p>
								<p>We'll be there in the trenches with you on the day of the event, handling any problem that comes up and making sure everyone is happy. But it doesn't end there -  we'll provide you a detailed recap afterwards, including presentations to leadership and comprehensive metrics. We'll even take out the trash. </p>
