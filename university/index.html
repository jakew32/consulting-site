						<h2>University Hackathons</h2>
						<p>We got our start organizing university hackathons. We want to help others do the same.</p>

						<h3>University Events</h3>
						<p>A university hackathon is one of the purest forms of a hackathon - it offers the kind of crazy, up-all-night ingenuity that everyone wants to be a part of. Whether you're a novice programmer who doesn't know the difference between HTML and CSS, a business major looking for partners to make a startup, a designer searching for a portfolio, or a top-level coder looking to take a crack at machine learning, a hackathon is for you.</p>
						<p>Codified grew out of organizing university hackathons. The challenges and tribulations we faced organizing our first events gave us strength, but having a dedicated partner who knew the ropes would have helped us tremendously. We want to give back by offering free help to any university students interested in organizing their own hackathon.</p>

								<h3>Organizing Help</h3>
								<p>If you need help organizing your hackathon, contact us. We'll be happy to help with whatever you need.</p>
								<p>Our team has experience organizing all sizes of events, and we have a huge library of best practices, vendors, requirements, and lessons learned to share with you. We'll get involved with your team, help guide you on your leadership journey, figure out the university bureaucracy, and even come out to have some fun with you at the event.</p>

								<h3>For Administrators</h3>
								<p>A hackathon can be an exciting way to accomplish many goals: increase student engagement, attract corporate sponsors to deepen their relationship with the university, provide alumni opportunities to give back, and result in some amazing projects to share with the world.</p>
								<p>Hackathons are complex to organize and often work best with student involvement. Codified can help work with you to identify students who are interested in hosting these events, mentor them on their journey, and offer you the security of having a trusted, experienced partner handle the crises that may arise.</p>
