						<h2>Community Events</h2>
						<p>Oftentimes, we find that community organizations (like goverments, chambers of commerce, colleges, and nonprofits) want to make hackathons a part of their programming. But they lack the experience or staff to help make this dream a reality. Codified helps these organizations achieve their goals in this field by offering no-cost partnerships with community agencies. </p>

								<h3>What can we do?</h3>
								<p>Codified can help with all portions of the event planning process - permitting, planning, sourcing, staffing, sponsorship, and more. Our team has experience organizing events at any scale, from 50 people to 1000+. We can handle budgets of any size, and will work with you to ensure that the event is financially sustainable.</p>
								<p>We also will help you integrate events into your strategic plan - often, a standard hackathon may not be the best fit for your audience. We can help you determine what sort of event will make the most impact, then help you execute it flawlessly.</p>

								<h3>Who have we worked with before?</h3>
								<p>Codified has helped major organizations and goverments execute events. Our staff members have experience working with many different groups, ranging from Fortune 500 corporations to local startups. We have also worked with cities and major events to bolster their programming.</p>
								<p>In one notable instance, Codified staff were approached to design and execute a large hackathon within the confines of a major weekend-long event, drawing over 100,000 attendees. With our experience, we attracted sponsors to both events, leveraged joint resources to deliver cost savings, marketed the event and its mission to thousands more people, and successfully executed the event under budget and on schedule.</p>
